# Information about the menu
Small project made by me (Grizzle) for the game Funky Friday on Roblox 

You can do funny things with it such as bypassing the tag limit, 
and also there's an auto solo match toggle, that will automatically trigger a solo match even in public Funky Friday lobbies. 

You can use literally almost any lua executor to use this, but some features may not work like Auto-Solo Match or Rainbow Tag. 

# Command
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flashintv/funkyFriday-Menu/main/main.lua'),true))()
```
